# Currency Converter: Any Currency to INR

## Overview
This is a simple Flask web application that converts any currency amount to Indian Rupees (INR) using live exchange rates from the Fixer API.

## Why I Built This
I created this project to learn how to build web applications with Python Flask and work with external APIs. It helped me understand how to fetch data from APIs, process user input, and display results dynamically.

## Features
- Converts from many international currencies to INR
- Uses live exchange rates from Fixer.io
- User-friendly interface with Bootstrap styling
- Error handling for invalid input or API issues
